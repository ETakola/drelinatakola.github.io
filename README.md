**Welcome! I’m Dr. Elina Takola.
I am a postdoctoral researcher and the leader of the BIOECOS group at Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ).
This is my website: [https://etakola.github.io/ ]([url](https://etakola.github.io/ ))

I study how individual animals move and behave in their environments. By combining GPS tracking with satellite data, we’re uncovering how each animal’s unique choices shape their ecological niche. While many studies look at populations as a whole, we know less about what drives differences between individuals. My research focuses on filling that gap, using northern lapwings as a case study to see how individuals select habitat and move differently through the landscape.
Some of my major achievements so far:

🛰️ Developed new methods combining movement models and remote sensing to uncover how individual animals interact with their environment.

📚 Published research on movement ecology, individual niche variation, and biodiversity-productivity relationships in leading journals.

🐦 Led GPS tracking projects on bird species across space and time, revealing fine-scale individual differences in habitat use.

🌍 Collaborated with researchers and students across the world to address ecological and conservation challenges.

🎙️ Presented my research at international conferences and held synthesis workshops in different countries.

🏆 Won multiple prizes and obtained funding for research.

📢 Actively advocated for open science, promoting transparency, data sharing, and accessible research practices within the ecological community.

🖥️ Actively developed reproducible workflows in R and shares tools with the community to improve transparency and collaboration.
