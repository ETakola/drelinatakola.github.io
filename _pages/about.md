I am a postdoctoral researcher and the leader of the BIOECOS group at Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ).


I study how individual animals move and behave in their environments. By combining GPS tracking with satellite data, we’re uncovering how each animal’s unique choices shape their ecological niche. While many studies look at populations as a whole, we know less about what drives differences between individuals. My research focuses on filling that gap, using northern lapwings as a case study to see how individuals select habitat and move differently through the landscape. 


Some of my major achievements so far: 

1. Developed new methods combining movement models and remote sensing to understand individual animal behavior.
1. Published research on movement ecology and niche variation in top journals.
1. Led projects tracking northern lapwings with high-resolution GPS devices.
1. Worked with students and collaborators from around the world to explore ecological questions.
1. Contributed to conservation by linking individual behavior to habitat management.
